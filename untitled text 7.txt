Hi XXXXX,

Just wanted to follow up in case you missed my last email. I know you’re an incredibly busy person, so I thought I’d give my message a little bump to the top of your pile.

Would you be free for a short 10-minute call on (mention specific date and time) for a quick chat?

Best regards,
Rafik
